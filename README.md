## How to

### Creating Headings

Use `#` symbols before text for headings. One `#` for `h1`, two `##` for `h2`, etc., with a space after the symbols.

**This is an `h3`:**
- ### This is an h3 title example created by writing `### This is an h3 title example created by writing ...`
- #### This is an h4 title example created by writing `#### This is an h4 title example created by writing ...`
- ##### This is an h5 title example created by writing `##### This is an h5 title example created by writing ...`

### Writing Normal and Plain Text

Just type to add normal text without any special formatting.

### Formatting Text with italic and bold

- **bold**: write two asterisks before and after the word or the sentence as `**bold**`.
- *italic*: write one asterisk before and after the word or the sentence as `*italic*`.

### Making Lists

It's possible to create both ordered and unordered lists.

1. **Unordered Lists**

Use in the beginning of the line one of these: asterisks (`*`), pluses (`+`), or hyphens (`-`).

Example:

```markdown
- list item
  - subitem
```

1. **Ordered Lists**

Just number each item

```markdown
1. list item
2. list item 2
  1. subitem
```

**Note:**

- Start a new line for each list item.
- Add a space after the list marker.
